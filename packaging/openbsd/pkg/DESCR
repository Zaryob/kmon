This is a simple VM and I/O monitor that takes vmstat output and pairs it with
the top CPU consumers displaying some useful stats on each PID.
The purpose of this script is performance monitoring and troubleshooting
bottlenecks all in one screen.

And yes, I am a huge IBM fan and yes, I did get influenced by Nigel's Monitor.
